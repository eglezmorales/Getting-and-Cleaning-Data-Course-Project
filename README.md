#**Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**

This is the project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course which goal is 
to create one R script called 'run_analysis.R' that performs the following five steps.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##**Files**

* 'CodeBook.Rmd' is the file that explain the way to select and obtain the final variables 
in the tidy-data set, as well as their description and those that was excluded from the 
raw-data set.
* 'r_analysis.R' is the file with the script that performs the project.
* 'dataAvgTidy.txt' is the file that shows the result.
